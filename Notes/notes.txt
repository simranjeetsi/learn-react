Package.json is a  configuration file  for npm it keeps tracks of the packages version installed in our app

Bundler helps to minify,cache and bundle together all the files, so it can be shipped to prod. For example webpack, parcel, vite

npm install -D parcel (two types of dependencies we can isntall one is dev dependency and other is normal, 
dev dependency is only used using development , 
normal can be used in prod, so -D will make it a dev dependency)

package-lock.json  keep track of exact version installed , package-lock keeps hash so whatever on my machine installed should be exact same on the prod

node_modules contains all the code we fetched from npm, whenever we install a package


npx parcel index.html, npx means executing a package, parcel goes to source index.html it will create a build for our app

CDN links are not a preferred way to add any framework or library, it is a  network call, and we will have to update
the url whenever the new version releases

Always use npm to install framework or library
npm install react
npm install react-dom

npx parcel build index.html to create a prod buid
